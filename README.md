## Project: SQL Alchemy Homework

## Description:
This project was created to demonstrate a number of data engineering and data analysis concepts using a data set of weather data (recorded precipitation and temperature values) from various weather stations in Hawaii. Data from the database was imported into a Jupyter Notebook using the SQLAlchemy ORM. Data was subsequently analyzed using Pandas DataFrames and graphs were created using the Matplotlib library.

## Additional Observations and Analysis:
- The average temperature in June (aggregated across all stations) is several degrees higher than the average temperature in December, as expected. The results of the independent (unpaired) t-test indicate that this difference is statistically significant (low p-value indicates the difference in average temperature did not occur by chance).
- The average temperature for the one year period chosen betwen June 1, 2016 and May 31, 2017 is approximately 74.39 째F. The graphically represented error bar on the output graph (indicating potential variability or "uncertainty") has a size representative of 29 degrees, as calculated by taking the period's high temperature and substracting the period's low temperature (87 째F and 58 째F, respectively).
- The average daily rainfall per weather station for the selected date range is very low, with the maximum value recorded at the station which also has the highest elevation.
- Based on the data available, the average temperature for the first week of June (aggregated across all stations) is approximately 74.57 째F.
